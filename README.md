# fucket

What do you do when you need to store something and take it somewhere but you can't simply use a mundane bucket?
You say "fuck it" and put it in the fucket bucket of course.

Fuckets are basically like buckets but better. The anser to the storage problems you never thought you had.
- Have a lot of items that don't stack? Fucket. 
- Out of room in your inventory? Fucket. 
- Need to transport some cows? Fucket. 
- Battling the end dragon in the end not your style and need to take it elsewhere? Fucket.
- Found a dope tree and want to plant it in your garden and you need that _exact_ tree? Fucket.
- Have some dirt but too trendy to put it in your inventory? Fucket.
- Ghasts' fireballs making the nether hell? Fucket.
- Scared of lightning? Fucket.

Why you may ask? Because Fucket.
